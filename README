sFlow 0.10

  This is version 0.10 of sFlow.pm, a module decoding sFlow datagrams 
  version 2, 3, 4 and 5. 

  sFlow is an industry standard technology for monitoring high speed 
  switched or routed networks. The technology is built into network 
  equipment and gives complete visibility into network activity, 
  enabling effective management and control of network resources.

  You can find more about sFlow on sflow.org. The datastructure of sFlow 
  v.4 is described in RFC 3176 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3176.txt) and 
  sFlow v.5 in a memo on sflow.org (http://sflow.org/sflow_version_5.txt). 

  Also have a look at the format diagrams on the specification page 
  (http://sflow.org/developers/specifications.php).

  I am very interested to recieve bug reports, comments, or whatever you 
  would like to share with me :)
