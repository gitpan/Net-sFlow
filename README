sFLOW

This is the first release of sFlow.pm, a module decoding sFlow datagrams 
version 2, 3, 4 and 5. 

sFlow is an industry standard technology for monitoring high speed switched 
networks. The technology is built into network equipment and gives complete 
visibility into network activity, enabling effective management and control 
of network resources.

You can find more about sFlow on sflow.org. The datastructure of sFlow v.4 
is described in RFC 3176 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3176.txt) and of sFlow 
v.5 in a memo on sflow.org (http://sflow.org/sflow_version_5.txt). Due to 
these descriptions being sometimes a pain to read I made some diagrams that 
I hope are easier to understand:

Version 4: http://jasinska.de/sFlow/sFlowV4FormatDiagram/
Version 5: http://jasinska.de/sFlow/sFlowV5FormatDiagram/

I am very interested to recieve bug reports, comments, or whatever you would 
like to share with me :)
